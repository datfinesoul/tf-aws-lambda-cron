# tf-aws-lambda-cron

## Development

### Notes

- S3 bucket/prefix with versioning is required if publish=true
- Currently only works with JS
- branches list (first branch will be the actual cron)

### ToDo

- See if how to add aliased provider
- other option, maybe let github create and manage aliases?
